# Github Student Developer Pack
<a href="https://education.github.com/pack">  <b>Github Student Developer Pack</b></a> is
an awesome pack, which can be obtained by an educational email. It includes a lot cool
developer tools (<b>namecheap.com</b> is one of them) for free only if you are a student.

# GitHub Pages
<a href="https://pages.github.com">  <b>Github Pages</b></a> is a service given by GitHub.
 Allows you to serve a site for your GitHub account and even unlimited number of sites
 your your projects on GitHub and its totally free! To start your site served by GitHub
 you need to create a named <b>&lt;your_github_username&gt;.github.io </b> and push your
 site under that repository. After pushing your repository you can visit
 <b>&lt;your_github_username&gt;.github.io </b> from your browser to see your site live!

# Namecheap.com
<a href="https://www.namecheap.com">  <b>Namecheap.com</b></a> is a domain name registrar.
 Namecheap gives a free <b> .me </b> domain free for a year (normally $8.99/year).
 You can get this promotion by acquiring your Github Student Developer Pack.

# Jekyll
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com">  <b>Jekyll</b></a> is an awesome project and it is open
source on GitHub. Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a
template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown
 (or Textile) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static
 website. Jekyll also works perfect with GitHub Pages. You can serve your jekyll site
 on GitHub Pages for free. You can see the quick-start guide of jekyll
 <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/">  <b>here</b></a>.

# Thinny
<a href="https://github.com/camporez/Thinny">  <b>Thinny</b></a> is an open source theme
for Jekyll which i like a lot, by <a href="https://github.com/camporez">  
<b>camporez</b></a>.

# Dillinger
<a href="http://dillinger.io">  <b>Dillinger</b></a> is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready,
offline-storage, AngularJS powered HTML5 Markdown editor. I use dilligner to write my
posts for jekyll (jekyll uses markdown files to generate your static html files). Write
your markdown files using dillinger and see their HTML conversation at the same time,
amazing huh?

# Disqus
<a href="https://disqus.com">  <b>Disqus</b></a> is a very cool tool that can be plugged
into various platforms to enable comments. For this jekyll based blog it is a JavaScript
code snippet that Disqus gave me to plug into my HTML templates. It is pretty simple and
powerful!

# Google Analytics
<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">  <b>Google Analytics</b></a> is another simple
 but powerful plugin that can be embedded easily into your website just like Disqus. Get
 your JavaScript code snippet from Google Analytics and put it into your HTML templates
 and you have that valuable data about your website and its visitors!
